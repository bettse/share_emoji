# Share Emoji 😄📲

Built for the GUITION 1.8” 360x360 ESP32-S3-JC3636W518 to share emoji between devices via websocket ([sockethook.ericbetts.dev](https://sockethook.ericbetts.dev/)). 🚀✨

## Usage 🛠️

1. 🔌 Power the device. If this is your first time, connect to **AutoConnectAP** to set up Wifi. 📶
2. 👉 Tap an emoji on the ring to select it.
3. 💬 When the websocket event is received, the selected emoji will be displayed in the center. 😃

_If you select an emoji and your center doesn't change, it could mean the Wifi or Websocket connection is not working. ❌_
